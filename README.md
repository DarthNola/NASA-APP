# NASA APOD React App
Project Overview
This project is a basic React application built to learn React fundamentals and how to fetch data from an API while caching the responses in the browser's local storage. The app uses the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to display daily images and information.

## Features
Fetches data from the NASA APOD API.
Caches API responses in local storage to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.
Displays the fetched image along with its title and description.
Tools and Technologies
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
NASA APOD API: An API that provides daily astronomical images and related information.
## Usage
When you open the app, it will automatically fetch the Astronomy Picture of the Day from the NASA API. The data will be cached in the browser's local storage, so subsequent visits on the same day will load the cached data instead of making a new API call.
